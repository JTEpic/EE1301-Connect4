current goals:

desync sendCoord since photon too fast,solution to refresh faster
correct LED algorithm? needs to use multiple per section and skip
resetBoard, put into success function
player switching on photon,reset players at launch+reset button
checkwin in photon code (use cloud function?)/LED animation based by player

checkWin to work with different dimensions (4x5)?

things to enable when done:

javascript photon2 access keys
javascript auto refresh line
javascript handleClick player switching line

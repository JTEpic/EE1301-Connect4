current goals:

correct LED algorithm?
desync sendCoord since photon too fast,player switching on photon,reset players at launch+reset button
checkwin in photon code (use cloud function?)/LED animation win based by player
resetBoard, put into success function

checkWin to work with different dimensions (4x5)
LED for loop

things to enable when done:

javascript photon2 access keys
javascript auto refresh line
javascript handleClick player switching line
